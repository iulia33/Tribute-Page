  <ul>
    <li>Gabrielle Bonheur "Coco" Chanel was born on 19thof August 1883.</li>
    <li>She was a French fashion designer and businesswoman. She was the founder and namesake of the Chanel brand.</li>
    <li>A prolific fashion creator, Chanel extended her influence beyond couture clothing, realising her design aesthetic in jewellery, handbags, and fragrance.</li>
    <p class="text-center font-italic text-muted quation-wrap">"The best things in life are free. The second-best are very expensive."</p>
    <li>Her signature scent, Chanel No. 5, has become an iconic product. </li>
    <li>She is the only fashion designer listed on TIME magazine's list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century.</li>
    <p class="text-center font-italic text-muted quation-wrap">"Simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance."</p>
    <li>Chanel was known for her lifelong determination, ambition, and energy which she applied to her professional and social life. 
</li>
    <li>In 1915, Harper's Bazaar raved over Chanel's designs: "The woman who hasn't at least one Chanel is hopelessly out of fashion …"</li>
    <p class="text-center font-italic text-muted quation-wrap">"Luxury must be comfortable, otherwise is not luxury."</p>
    <li>Main legacy as a designer:
      <ul>
        <li>Chanel's initial triumph was the innovative use of jersey fabric, a machine knit material manufactured for her by the firm Rodier.</li>
        <li>The Chanel tweed suit was built for comfort and practicality. It consisted of a jacket and skirt in supple and light wool or mohair tweed and a blouse and jacket lining in jersey or silk. </li>
        <li>After the jersey suit, the concept of the little black dress is often cited as a Chanel contribution to the fashion lexicon; it is a style still worn to this day.</li>
        <li>In 1929 Chanel offered a handbag inspired by soldier's bags. Its thin shoulder strap allowed the user to have her hands free.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
     <p class="text-center font-italic text-muted quation-wrap rounded">"If you're sad, add more lipstick and attack."</p>
    <li>As 1971 began, Chanel was 87 years old, tired, and ailing. She carried out her usual routine of preparing the spring catalogue. She had gone for a long drive the afternoon of Saturday, 9 January. Soon after, feeling ill, she went to bed early.[108] She died on Sunday, 10 January 1971, at the Hotel Ritz
</li>
    <p class="text-center font-italic text-muted quation-wrap">"Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself."</p>
  </ul>
